# Releasing a New Version
To release a new version of this package, follow the steps below:

## Create a New Release:

- Navigate to the Releases section of the repository.
- Click "Draft a new release."
- Assign a new tag to the release. This tag should follow the format X.X.X (e.g., 1.0.2), where each part of the version string represents a different level of change (see Versioning section below).
- Ensure the new version is greater than the previous version tag.

## Versioning Guidelines:

A consistent versioning scheme helps users understand the evolution of the package over time. The following convention is recommended:

- The First number (e.g., 1.x.x) indicates significant changes that may affect backward compatibility.
Minor Version (1.Y.0):

- The Second number (e.g., 1.2.x) is incremented for smaller, backward-compatible updates.
Patch Version (1.0.Z):

- The Third number (e.g., 1.2.3) is for bug fixes or minor updates that do not affect compatibility.

## Versioning Rules:
Breaking Changes (Major Versions):

- Increment the major version (X) when introducing breaking changes. For example, when a componentâ€™s API is altered in a way that existing implementations will no longer work (e.g., removing required props or removing a component entirely).
Backward-Compatible Updates (Minor Versions):

- Increment the minor version (Y) for new features, improvements, or updates that are backward-compatible.
Bug Fixes & Minor Updates (Patch Versions):

- Increment the patch version (Z) for minor changes such as bug fixes or internal updates that do not affect the existing functionality or compatibility of the components.
